## Overview

Blast Dark is an eye-candy Visual Studio Code (VSCode) theme which is especially made with long coding hours in mind. It features a custom color palette which combines both the lukewarm and the industrial feel into one, single theme. It's one of those projects which I had a lot of fun developing, just because it gives me a fair bit of chills.
